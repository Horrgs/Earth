# Earth
Congregate of multiple weather, climate, and geologic APIs pertaining to general public information.

### Status: WIP towards Alpha.

## Goal

The purpose of Earth is to be a one stop shop for weather & natural hazards information by providing an easy and in-depth way of monitoring the weather in whatever way at any place you desire. By registering locations, users will be able to easily monitor the weather at those locations and choose which notifications to priortize. Receive a daily summary of the weather near your house and weather alert warning notifications? See what the weather is forecasted to look like during your commute? Receive alerts for hurricanes or earthquakes above a certain rating? 


At this time, the front-end is up in the air between a web application like Django or Flask or using a GUI tool like tkinter. It is possible we can do both but its a matter of deciding if they would be independent apps or if you can go between your profile on the web & desktop app.


This is your one stop shop for Earth. Get in touch with it, understand it, and cherish it.
